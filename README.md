# Pac-Man Game - Microservices & Monolithic Versions

## Overview
This project is a Pac-Man game implemented in two versions:
1. **Monolithic Version**: All game logic, rendering, and interactions are handled in a single script.
2. **Microservices Version**: The game is split into multiple scripts (services), each handling a specific aspect of the game like game management, map, score, and rendering.

## Monolithic Version

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

### How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install pygame`
3. Run the game:  
   `python pacman_game.py`

### Features
- **Game Map**: A maze-like grid that Pac-Man navigates.
- **Enemies**: Randomly moving enemies that Pac-Man must avoid.
- **Shooting**: Pac-Man can shoot bullets to destroy enemies.
- **Score**: The score increases when Pac-Man collects food or defeats enemies.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if Pac-Man collides with an enemy.

## Microservices Version

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

### Services
- **Game Management** (`Game Management.py`): Handles the game logic, player movement, enemy behavior, and game state.
- **Map Generation** (`Map.py`): Generates and manages the maze map.
- **Score Management** (`Score.py`): Tracks and updates the player's score.
- **Rendering** (`Rendering.py`): Handles all visual elements of the game.
- **RUN** (`RUN.py`): The main script that starts all the services concurrently.

### How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install pygame`
3. Run the services:  
   `python RUN.py`

### Features
- **Game Logic**: Managed by the Game Management service.
- **Map**: Generated by the Map service.
- **Score**: Managed by the Score service.
- **Rendering**: Handled by the Rendering service.
- All services are started and managed by the `RUN.py` script.

### Shutting Down
You can stop all services using `Ctrl + C` (KeyboardInterrupt). This will terminate all running processes gracefully.
